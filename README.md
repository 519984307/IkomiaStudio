## Presentation

Ikomia Studio is an Open Source desktop application that aims to simplify use, reproducibility and sharing of state of the art algorithms in Computer Vision. It comes with [a collaborative marketplace](https://ikomia.com/en/plugins) where users can find Plug'n Play algorithms or publish research work in one click. As this marketplace will keep growing, Ikomia Studio should be a great tool to promote research in Computer Vision and Deep Learning. It is also well suited to simplify and speed up R&D and prototyping for companies. The software is written in C++ and based on Qt framework.

Key features:
- No-code image processing workflows
- State of the art Plug'n Play algorithms from [Ikomia marketplace](https://ikomia.com/en/plugins)
- Almost full integration of [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/)
- Comprehensive [Python API](https://ikomia-dev.github.io/python-api-documentation/) to plug your algorithms
- [MLflow](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow) integration for Deep Learning experiments
- Input data from image, volume, vid√©os or camera
